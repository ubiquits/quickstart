Isomorphic Javascript Framework build in TypeScript

## Note
Ubiquits is currently pre-alpha. Follow https://twitter.com/ubiquits for updates

## Overview
Ubiquits is a typescript full stack framework, with primary goals being cross-environment reusability and api rigidity achieved through strong typing and documentation/test automation.

## Goals
1. Angular(2) at it's core. There is no need to reinvent the wheel, and where possible Ubiquits will use Angular components
2. API first (or only). A ubiquits application could be just a REST api with no frontend
3. Strict, standards compliant API - strict interfaces for API design conforms to REST standards and best practices, allowing for easy interoperability of components (first or third party)
4. Common components between front & back end. Models, mocks, utilities etc are all platform independent
5. Easy integration. A developer should be able to integrate a full stack component with only an npm install (or custom package management)
6. Seamless (and continuous) deployment. Deploys should be completely hassle free, including database migrations
